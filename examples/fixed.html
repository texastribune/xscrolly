        Here's how you can use this to do a fixed header. It's not as elegant as
        a dedicated fixed positioning plugin, but gives you more control. For
        example, this example shows how the fixed header can turn itself off at
        the bottom of the page. You may need to come up with some creative
        selectors or add cheater elements. There's definitely lots of ways to
        skin this cat using <code>xcrolly</code>. This example is based on the
        <a href="spy.html">scroll spy example</a>.
